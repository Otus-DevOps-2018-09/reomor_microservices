Docker images are the basis of containers. 
An Image is an ordered collection of root filesystem changes and the corresponding execution parameters for use within a container runtime.
An image typically contains a union of layered filesystems stacked on top of each other. An image does not have state and it never changes.

A container is a runtime instance of a docker image WITH state, consists of:
 - image
 - an execution environment
 - a standard set of instructions
